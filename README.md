# Crystal Skull

![Crystal Skull](crystal_skull.jpg)

For developers who want to build an innovative quiz app, Crystal Skull is a server that generates complete quizzes using just a topic name or supplied text. Unlike other quiz generators, our product is unique and easy to use.

The name _Crystal Skull_ comes from the movie _[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367882/)_. The movie shows an alien with a crystal skull who seems to have knowledge on everything. This program, too, seems to have knowledge on everything ðŸ˜‰.

## Installation

### Server

Install [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community).

To serve at `http://localhost:80`, run `docker run --rm -p 80:80 neelkamath/crytal-skull`.

You can find specific versions on the [Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/neelkamath/crystal-skull/tags).

The container `EXPOSE`s port `80`.

### Generating an SDK

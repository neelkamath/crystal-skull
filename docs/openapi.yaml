                            Jobs back.`. Although both the questions are different (and would have different options),

                            `Apple was founded by Steve Jobs in April 1976.` for example. Two questions may be generated
                            from this, one being `Apple was founded by Steve Jobs in April 1976.` (where the answer is
                            `Steve Jobs`), and another might be `Apple was founded by Steve Jobs in April 1976.` (where
                            the answer is `April 1976`). Although the questions and answers (and hence, options) are
                            different, they are based on the same sentence. This has the potential of making the quiz
                            slightly boring, or having certain questions too easy since the user already knows the
                            answer to the next duplicate sentence because they have read the rest of the same sentence
                            in a previous question.
